// The `package pubsub` statement in Go is declaring that the current file belongs to the `pubsub`
// package. This allows you to organize your code into logical units and control visibility of
// functions, variables, and types within that package. Other Go files can then import and use the
// functionality provided by the `pubsub` package.
