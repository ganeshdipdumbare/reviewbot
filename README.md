# ReviewBot

## Start backend server

Start backend server which is responsible for returning message to the user.
Also the server is responsible for creating conversation and reviews.

```bash
# go to backend dir
cd backend

# run backend server
make start

# test backend
make test
```

## Start frontend

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
